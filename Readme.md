# **Single-Cell Multi-Omics Analysis Reveals Key Molecular Alterations and Tumour-Immune Interactions in Breast Cancer Brain Metastasis**

Brain metastasis is a major cause of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, but the molecular mechanisms driving this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed single-cell multi-omics approaches to investigate the tumour immune microenvironment (TIME) and cellular interactions associated with breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM). Our analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and metastatic tumour cells (MTCs), identifying distinct spatiotemporal distribution patterns and roles for various TAM subtypes in the brain metastatic process. Notably, circulating TAMs exhibited M1-like traits, while tissue-resident TAMs showed more M2-like characteristics. Early in metastasis, LST1⁺ TAMs facilitate blood–brain barrier (BBB) penetration, while APOE⁺, SPP1⁺, and NLRP3⁺ TAMs play crucial roles in stabilizing metastatic foci and promoting an immunosuppressive microglial phenotype that supports tumour growth. We also identified five molecular subtypes of MTCs, including neuro-related cells that adapt to the brain microenvironment by activating neuronal signalling pathways. A key finding was the high-frequency mutations and overexpression of GABRB3 and NRXN1 in both primary tumours and brain metastases, correlating with increased metastatic risk and poor patient outcomes. These genes regulate growth factor and cell adhesion pathways, and their silencing significantly impaired tumour cell proliferation and brain colonization. Our study suggests GABRB3 and NRXN1 as promising biomarkers for early BCBM detection and therapeutic targets. These findings offer novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of brain metastasis and propose potential strategies for early diagnosis and treatment of BCBM in breast cancer.
